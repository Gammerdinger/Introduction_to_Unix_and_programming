# About this resources

This guide was written by Will Gammerdinger at IST Austria between late 2018 and early 2019. It is intended to help introduce people to the Unix command line and basic programming architectures. It was designed to work on the computer lab computers at IST Austria, but all of the ideas should be applicable to other Unix systems. However some of the paths and defaults may be different. The course is split into three days with each day building on the material of the previous day(s).
