# Basics of *for* Loops

## The Problem

You have a long list of items that you would like a series of commands to be iterated over. Common examples of this could be:

* You want to repeat an action a set number of times
* You want to create a sequence of numbers
* You want to modify many similar files

## The Solution

Loops!!! All of these problems are perfect places to implement loops. Loops ar a common programming structure found in virtually all programming languages. Generally speaking, there are several varieties of loops including *for* loops, *while* loops, *until* loops among others. The most common loops are *for* loops, but the other loops certainly have their places. For example, *while* loops are frequently used for reading files. In this tutorial, we are going to focus on *for* loops.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

* To modify an existing *for* loop
* To design a *for* loop
